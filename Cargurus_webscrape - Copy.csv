Reviews: * Comfortable but confident ride quality; many available high-tech features; fuel-efficient engines; classy-looking interior; maneuverable size. Source: Edmunds * The 2015 GMC Canyon is small enough to fit in a garage and is easier to park and has better fuel economy than a full-size truck, yet can still tow a trailer or carry gear. But the Canyon is refined, with arguably the nicest interior in its segment. Source: KBB.com * The all-new 2015 GMC Canyon will redefine the small truck category with segment-leading features that make it more capable and versatile than any other midsize pickup on the market. Canyon's 305hp 3.6L V6 engine is the most powerful in its segment. When equipped with the trailering package, it offers a Best-in-Class Max Trailering rating of 7,000 lbs. The 2.5L engine is the most powerful in the segment with 200hp. Both engines feature direct injection and variable valve timing. A 6-speed manual transmission is standard on the 2WD SL and extended cab base Canyon trim levels, and an automatic transmission is standard on all other models. Canyon's cabin is precisely crafted, exceptionally quiet and comfortable, and designed to the highest standards. The craftsmanship, attention to details and premium materials are what you expect from all GMC vehicles. Canyon features inlaid, triple-sealed doors, thick windshield and side glass, and liquid-applied sound deadener to help reduce wind noise inside the cab and keep the road noise out. The Canyon was designed to be efficient and maneuverable, yet make a powerful and lasting first impression. Manage your cargo and protect your truck bed with the largest cargo box in a midsized pickup, integrated CornerStep rear bumper for easy access to the box, and available EZ-Lift and Lower tailgate. OnStar offers available 4G LTE built-in Wi-Fi hotspot so you stay connected to the internet and your favorite apps anywhere you go. The standard Rear Vision Camera helps to provide clarity and peace of mind while maneuvering and parking. The available 8-inch-diagonal Color Touch Radio with next-generation IntelliLink lets you customize your media and connect with unprecedented ease.

Priced below KBB Fair Purchase Price! Reviews: * Beyond its history of reliability and high resale value, the Accord is now more varied than ever. Whether you want a no-fuss and highly economical sedan, a sporty V6-powered coupe or a hybrid that attains 50 mpg in the city, the 2014 Accord offers something for everyone. Source: KBB.com * The Accord Coupe has always been the sporty option for those looking for the reliability and value that Honda provides. The Accord is synonymous with Honda and has been known for nearly four decades as a reliable, comfortable, pragmatic way to move families. What began as a 2-door hatchback in 1976 has grown into today's full-size sedan and coupe. Like the rest of the car, the 2014 Accord's 5-passenger interior is a pleasing step forward. The cabin boasts soft-touch materials for a quality feel. The front seats are comfortable, and the driver's seat actually toned down the lumbar support. The rear seats have even more room, as does the trunk. Sleek, rippled sheet metal defines a more streamlined exterior that has shrunk around an interior that feels roomier than previous generations. The most surprising thing about the Accord is its refined continuously variable transmission (CVT). Mated to the 4-cylinder, this CVT feels much like a normal automatic, mimicking gear changes. Even a base Accord has good power for acceleration and passing, yet attains an impressive mileage on the highway. Move up to a V6 model with 6-speed automatic transmission, and the Accord is downright quick. If you want a hassle-free, pleasing family car with a reputation for quality and an immediate familiarity, you can't go wrong with the Accord.

Reviews: * Comfortable but confident ride quality; many available high-tech features; fuel-efficient engines; classy-looking interior; maneuverable size. Source: Edmunds * The 2015 GMC Canyon is small enough to fit in a garage and is easier to park and has better fuel economy than a full-size truck, yet can still tow a trailer or carry gear. But the Canyon is refined, with arguably the nicest interior in its segment. Source: KBB.com * The all-new 2015 GMC Canyon will redefine the small truck category with segment-leading features that make it more capable and versatile than any other midsize pickup on the market. Canyon's 305hp 3.6L V6 engine is the most powerful in its segment. When equipped with the trailering package, it offers a Best-in-Class Max Trailering rating of 7,000 lbs. The 2.5L engine is the most powerful in the segment with 200hp. Both engines feature direct injection and variable valve timing. A 6-speed manual transmission is standard on the 2WD SL and extended cab base Canyon trim levels, and an automatic transmission is standard on all other models. Canyon's cabin is precisely crafted, exceptionally quiet and comfortable, and designed to the highest standards. The craftsmanship, attention to details and premium materials are what you expect from all GMC vehicles. Canyon features inlaid, triple-sealed doors, thick windshield and side glass, and liquid-applied sound deadener to help reduce wind noise inside the cab and keep the road noise out. The Canyon was designed to be efficient and maneuverable, yet make a powerful and lasting first impression. Manage your cargo and protect your truck bed with the largest cargo box in a midsized pickup, integrated CornerStep rear bumper for easy access to the box, and available EZ-Lift and Lower tailgate. OnStar offers available 4G LTE built-in Wi-Fi hotspot so you stay connected to the internet and your favorite apps anywhere you go. The standard Rear Vision Camera helps to provide clarity and peace of mind while maneuvering and parking. The available 8-inch-diagonal Color Touch Radio with next-generation IntelliLink lets you customize your media and connect with unprecedented ease.

Protect Highly Vulnerable Door Edges When the unavoidable happens, 3M Door Edge Protection Film makes sure a small mistake doesn't turn into a big problem down the road. As much as we all try to be careful with our cars, it's a common situation where a car door is opened and the edge bumps into the concrete wall of a parking ramp, or the guard rail in a parking lot, or the posts near gasoline pumps, or any of a thousand other places. It seems like a small thing at first, but it's just enough to scrape or chip the paint. But once the paint has an abrasion, it could lead to further chipping or even rust. 3M Door Edge Protection Film gives your car an important chip -- the clear coated urethane measure of protection. 3M PROTECTION IS PRE INSTALLED FOR A OPTIONAL PRICE OF $695 IN ADDITION TO THE ADVERTISED PRICE.

FWD 1-Speed Automatic Priced below KBB Fair Purchase Price! 35/40 City/Highway MPG Awards: * 2014 IIHS Top Safety Pick+ with optional front crash prevention * 2014 KBB.com 10 Best Green Cars * 2014 KBB.com Brand Image Awards Reviews: * Low monthly fuel cost in normal driving; useful 300-plus-mile maximum range; pleasing number of standard features; excellent crash test scores. Source: Edmunds * The 2014 Chevrolet Volt electric plug-in hybrid represents a unique twist on the hybrid-car theme. The Volt runs purely on electric current. Once its battery pack is depleted (after 25 to 50 miles), the Volt's gasoline engine kicks on to run a generator, powering the electric motors and helping recharge the batteries. This extends the Volt's range an additional 300 miles or more. The Volt features a Hold mode in its drive selection to conserve battery charge, and a no-cost-option low-emissions package qualifies the Volt for single-occupancy HOV lanes in California and New York. The Hold mode is useful, for example, when driving on a freeway heading into the city, where you'll want the full electric charge available. The 2014 Chevy Volt's electric motor delivers a big dose of torque right from the get-go, letting the car sprint away quickly from a standing start. The interior is covered in bright white and dark accented plastics and touch-sensitive controls for the audio and climate-control functions. Two 7-inch LCD screens replace the traditional analog gauges, with one serving as the instrument cluster (speedometer, fuel, and range gauges) and the other mounted atop the center stack displaying the electric motor/battery operation as well as the available navigation screen. With the goal of total operating efficiency, the Chevrolet Volt's design team crafted a body shape that could cheat the wind. Up front are a rounded nose, closed grille opening and steeply raked windshield. Sharp edges along the Volt's rear fenders help slice through the wind, as does the functional rear hatch spoiler. This is one of the most aerodynamic cars in GM's long history. If you're worried a pure electric car won't be able to satisfy your distance requirements before needing to be recharged, the 2014 Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid electric sedan is the answer: It carries a charging station around with it, in the form of its 1.4-liter gasoline engine.

Priced below KBB Fair Purchase Price! 27/36 City/Highway MPG Clean CARFAX. Reviews: * Beyond its history of reliability and high resale value, the Accord is now more varied than ever. Whether you want a no-fuss and highly economical sedan, a sporty V6-powered coupe or a hybrid that attains 50 mpg in the city, the 2014 Accord offers something for everyone. Source: KBB.com * The Accord is synonymous with Honda and has been known for nearly four decades as a reliable, comfortable, pragmatic way to move families. What began as a 2-door hatchback in 1976 has grown into today's full-size sedan and coupe. Like the rest of the car, the 2014 Accord's 5-passenger interior is a pleasing step forward. The cabin boasts soft-touch materials for a quality feel. The front seats are comfortable, and the driver's seat actually toned down the lumbar support. The rear seats have even more room, as does the trunk. Sleek, rippled sheet metal defines a more streamlined exterior that has shrunk around an interior that feels roomier than previous generations. The most surprising thing about the Accord is its refined continuously variable transmission (CVT). Mated to the 4-cylinder, this CVT feels much like a normal automatic, mimicking gear changes. Even a base Accord has good power for acceleration and passing, yet attains an impressive mileage on the highway. Move up to a V6 model with 6-speed automatic transmission, and the Accord is downright quick. For the individual looking to consume less the 2014 Accord comes in a Hybrid version as well. This operates on a 141-hp 2.0-liter, 16-valve i-VTEC 4-cylinder engine and a 55-hp lithium-ion battery pack for a net hp of 196. The Hybrid can achieve ratings of 50 cty and 46 hwy. To help maximize efficiency on the road, the Accord Hybrid seamlessly shifts between three distinct drive modes: EV Drive, Hybrid Drive and Engine Drive. EV Drive is 100% electric, and generally is used during braking and when starting from a stop. Hybrid Drive uses the fuel engine and electric motor to provide extra zip during acceleration, and once your Accord Hybrid is cruising with highway efficiency, Engine Drive takes over. If you want a hassle-free, pleasing family car with a reputation for quality and an immediate familiarity, you can't go wrong with the Accord.

Award calculated among non-luxury shoppers. For more information, visit www.kbb.com. Kelley Blue Book is a registered trademark of Kelley Blue Book Co., Inc. Reviews: * The 2014 Honda CR-V is as comfortable mushing through unplowed streets as it is circling the flea market ready to haul home some vintage antiques. Excellent fuel economy, a very reasonable price, and a near flawless repair record should seal the deal. Source: KBB.com * Abundant passenger and cargo room; good fuel economy; user-friendly controls; ample standard tech features; strong crash test scores. Source: Edmunds * The 2014 Honda CR-V has a modern aerodynamic look, with sweeping lines, exciting body sculpting, and a dramatic profile. It has enough attitude and ability to get you around town and then tackle the open road and the great outdoors. The CR-V comes equipped with a 2.4-Liter i-VTEC 4-Cylinder engine with 185 Horsepower and a 5-Speed Automatic Transmission. It has a rigid unit-body structure, coupled with taut suspension tuning, which give it impressive handling characteristics. For ultimate 4-season security, the 2014 CR-V is available with Honda's Real Time All-Wheel Drive with Intelligent Control System that smoothes out initial acceleration and can transfer up to 100 percent of torque to the rear wheels if necessary. The CR-V is very fuel-efficient and can get up to an EPA estimated 31 MPG Highway when in two-wheel drive. Hit the green ECON button, and the vehicle makes adjustments to its systems so they can be more efficient. Then you get feedback as you drive from Eco Assist to let you know how efficient your driving is. Honda has placed bars around the speedometer, and the longer you keep them in the green, the farther you can go on a tank of gas. The 5-passenger CR-V remains modestly sized on the outside, but is extremely roomy inside, with a rear seat that accommodates adults and a proper-sized cargo area. Special attention is paid to driver comfort, with supportive front seats that flank an accommodating center console punctuated by two big cup holders. A large covered center stow bin houses USB and auxiliary inputs as well as a 12-volt power point. Finally, its large single-piece liftgate, coupled with a significantly lower lift-over height, eases loading and unloading chores. Check out the 2014 Honda CR-V Today!

Excellent resale values help offset the high cost of purchase. Source: KBB.com * Top-notch interior craftsmanship; class-leading fuel economy; strong supercharged V6; superb brake performance; roomy backseat; sporty handling. Source: Edmunds * When a 2014 Audi Q5 drives by, its sporty and sophisticated profile can't be missed. From its dramatic wheels and classy aluminum roof rails to the graceful slope of its roof, this is one SUV that stands apart from the crowd. The Q5 has a Singleframe grille, sleek bumper and light designs, and signature Audi LED technology in the taillights and available daytime running lights. The Q5 presents its occupants with seats placed at the perfect height for easy entry and exit, with virtually no bending or stretching involved. After settling in, occupants find themselves in a cabin filled with luxurious leather and an eye-catching mix of aluminum accents and all-natural walnut trim. The dashboard has been laid out to serve the driver and features an available integrated MMI screen positioned close to the driver's line of sight. The comfortably firm seats provide plenty of room for five, with rear passengers enjoying the superb comfort awarded by reclining seats in a 40/20/40 split, independent climate controls, and privacy glass. The Q5 offers a choice between two engines, each blessed with the dual benefits of forced induction and TFSI direct fuel injection. The turbocharged 211hp 2.0L TFSI engine can achieve 28mpg on a highway cruise, while the supercharged V6 in the 3.0T model pumps out a robust 272hp and 295 pounds-feet of torque. With either engine, Audi quattro seamlessly spreads the power among all four wheels, all the time, enhancing traction under all conditions. Working in tandem with the sophisticated multilink suspension and electromechanical power steering system, the Q5 possesses an athletic on-road feel that is all too rare in the sport-utility world. Audi connect with Google Earth imagery and Wi-Fi connectivity allows for up to eight devices. Ten speakers and Audi concert radio amplify the single CD player, mp3 playback capability and iPod integration. Safety features abound in this graceful utility vehicle including power windows with pinch protection, airbags, five-link front suspension and trapezoidal-link rear suspension, lower anchors and tethers for car seats and tire pressure monitoring system.
